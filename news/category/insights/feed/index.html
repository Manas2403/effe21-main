<h3>Weird Work Works</h3>



<p>I could show you a phenomenal piece of advertising that is saving the world and cleaning up at award ceremonies. But I won’t. I wanted to take this chance to talk about what I want to see more of in advertising. The undeniable fact that weird work works. And by weird work I mean the uncanny, the strange, the bizarre. The mix of random, catchy, and odd that makes weird advertising memorable. </p>



<p>But why does it work? Well, the short answer is, we don’t fully know. Weird ads demand your attention and stay&nbsp;with you.&nbsp;And that’s exactly what great advertising should do.&nbsp;From a gorilla&nbsp;playing the drums to a Japanese commercial that features a mouth eating a snack from the back of a person’s neck. It doesn&#8217;t make sense, but it just works.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>I think right now we are at a turning point in advertising. The heaviness of being locked in our homes and living life on repeat has made us yearn for something new. Something odd and far away from the everyday. People want to be entertained and it’s our chance to win people&nbsp;over. For people to (dare&nbsp;I say) actually like advertising again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;great example of the weird renaissance on the way is&nbsp;the piece I have chosen to discuss.&nbsp;Starburst’s 2007 commercial “Bus Station” better known as “Little Lad&#8221; created by TBWA\Chiat\Day New York.&nbsp;It&#8217;s beautifully random and odd but underneath it drives the key product message -highlighting a new flavour. It was a risk and&nbsp;could have been a very different ad but everything worked out perfectly. The right director, (Randy Krallman)&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;casting, wardrobe, writing and a very trusting&nbsp;client.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p><br>Although a successful ad at the time it has had a resurgence and became relevant again after 14 years. In the&nbsp;past few months the character’s repetitive song and weird dance have been viewed more than 350 million times on TikTok. The ad has been remixed, danced to, haunted dreams and even inspired its own genre of fan fiction.&nbsp;So what is the magic that revived an ad 14 years&nbsp;later, on one of world’s most popular platforms? Weirdness.&nbsp;No outrageous gags. It’s just really and universally weird. Plain and simple.&nbsp;Those weird ads bury themselves in your mind. And there’s a new generation that love to see it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>by Aoife Murphy, Executive Strategy Director</em></p>



<p>Ever bought something, worn it, and returned it anyway? If you answered yes, apparently lots of other people do too, and it costs the fashion industry $15billion a year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="686" height="484" src="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2262" srcset="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel.png 686w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-600x423.png 600w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></figure>



<p>Instead of blacklisting serial returners or making a stricter returns policy, Italian fashion giant, Diesel, encouraged the practice.</p>



<p>Their ‘Enjoy Before Returning’ campaign for the autumn/winter line asked people to wear their clothes with the label out and return them to the store &#8211; no questions asked.</p>



<p>The launch featured a fashion show where all the models’ clothes had the labels on display and Diesel turned the exact words of their returns policy into a music video.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Enjoy Before Returning - DIESEL FW19" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtAuHfBYwJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The unexpected angle and edgy, 90s punk style execution gives the brand a sense of quiet rebellion while also showcasing the clothes beautifully.</p>



<h4>Why we like it</h4>



<p>Fashion is getting a bad rap at the minute on the sustainability front. Without preaching about their environmental strategy, Diesel actively leans into the circular economy movement. And they’re doing it with an attitude that makes Diesel look and feel distinct in what can sometimes be a same-y category.</p>



<p>Brand experiential should give you a clear sense of the brand and let you experience the product. This does both incredibly well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="776" height="548" src="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2261" srcset="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2.png 776w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2-768x542.png 768w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2-600x424.png 600w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px" /></figure>



<h4><strong>What can we learn from it?</strong></h4>



<p>Oftentimes, marketers are asked to move consumers from one behaviour to another. Accentuating or leveraging existing behaviour is often overlooked when it could be the path of least resistance.</p>



<p>Here, the confident approach of bringing a closed behaviour out into the open, ended up leading to reduced online and in-store return rate.</p>



<p>What early behaviours or trends are you seeing around your product or brand that you could lean into?</p>

<p><em>by Pat Stephenson, Chief Relationship Officer</em></p>



<p>Great work makes everything better. Better results, more satisfaction, better commercials. Everything. We’ve believed that for a <em>looong</em> time now. But it’s still rejuvenating when you get a large jolt of great work mainlined into your system. Which is exactly what’s happened to me over the weeks and months since we joined By The Network – an international network of the world’s leading independent agencies.<br> <br>Getting to know our amazing co-members has been &#8211; and is &#8211;  exhilarating. Literally every agency is top of their game  &#8211; sectorally or geographically – with best in class agencies all over the world from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mrpositive.work/" target="_blank">MrPositive</a> in Tokyo to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://girlsareawesome.com/" target="_blank">Girls Are Awesome</a>.<br> <br>So for Stuff We Like I wanted to pull out three of the best pieces I’ve seen from some of our new agency friends.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="THE HIRING CHAIN performed by STING | World Down Syndrome Day 2021" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKku4RAWa4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p><br /><span><strong>The Hiring Chain </strong></span><em><span>by Small</span></em><br /><br /><span>This is a really simple idea, brilliantly executed about the circular, multiplier effect of hiring someone with Down Syndrome &#8211; brought to life with a great song, sung by Sting. What’s not to like?</span><span><br /><br />This has absolutely beasted the award shows, and rightly so, picking up Silver and Bronze at Cannes, Graphite and Wood &amp; D&amp;AD and 2 Gold and a Silver at New York Festival. Small are such an incredible agency – their work for Diesel is absolutely top notch.</span></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>2030 Calculator&nbsp;</strong><em>by The Farm</em></p>



<p>Climate Change can feel like an impossible thing to try and tackle. At this stage most people realise there is a significant problem but other than some basic behaviours it can feel almost impossible to try and make meaningful changes.<br><br>This idea from the awesome people at <a href="https://www.farmagency.se/">The Farm</a> in Stockholm is a brilliantly simple prompt – A Carbon Calculator that allows any business to showcase the potential Carbon footprint of everything you buy – so as a consumer you are aware and can make better choices.</p>



<p>An idea build with utility and ease in mind, again this swept the floor at the awards shows winning a Grand Prix at Cannes, a D&amp;AD Yellow Pencil and a Grand Prix at Eurobest.</p>



<p></p>

</div></figure>



<p><span><strong>White Towels&nbsp;</strong></span><em><span>by Mortier Brigade</span></em><br><br><span>Lastly this is a devastatingly simple idea from <a href="https://mortierbrigade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://mortierbrigade.com/">Mortier Brigade</a> in Belgium that attempts to bring to life the real horror of the situation facing many refugees trying to get into Europe.&nbsp; It tackles the problem of these issues feeling so removed from our day to day – and manages to make them feel all too real.</span><span><br><br>Like the best ideas its simplicity is its strength&#8230;<br></span></p>
<p><span><br>I’ve barely scratched the surface of the surface when it comes to the amazing work and agencies within By The Network but if like me you take energy and stimulation from seeing great work feel free to check out <a href="https://bythenetwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://bythenetwork.com/">https://bythenetwork.com/</a> and get mainlining.</span></p>

<p>As a kid, the best present you got at Christmas was the one that came in the biggest cardboard box. With a little imagination, that box could become a race car, a castle, a pirate ship or a rocket. The possibilities were endless.<br><br>Now Samsung have gone and made cardboard boxes even cooler with a sustainability initiative that aims to reduce waste by repurposing cardboard packaging.<br><br>In collaboration with Papersmith, a paper artist, they created Small World, a beautiful world made entirely from cardboard packaging. This world was then brought to life in a 30-second animation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Papersmith’s designs are available to download as a make-it-yourself collection, so kids big and small can create their own magical worlds.<br>&nbsp;<br>This follows the introduction of Samsung Eco-Packaging last year, which shows consumers how to upcycle their packaging into various home furniture items like magazine racks or even TV stands.<br>&nbsp;<br>If ever you needed an excuse to buy that pair of runners or, I guess, that new TV.

<p><em>by Sarah Sherry, Business Director</em></p>



<p>Haircut or holiday? I obviously need both badly but this really nice piece from <strong>Tourism New Zealand</strong> has me yearning for a great big adventure more than a haircut. (Maybe I should just embrace my mousy brown hair, maybe I was never meant to be blonde….)&nbsp;</p>



<p>This simple and clever TV ad is targeted specifically at Australians, it aims to spark the emotional longing in Australians to experience a unique and meaningful New Zealand holiday as a quarantine-free travel bubble has just opened between the neighbouring countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As with all tourism ads it highlights both the welcoming people and stunning landscapes of New Zealand that we are all familiar with. But it’s the entertaining narrative that sets this apart. It’s the story of a dreaming Australian and a New Zealand guide as they experience a literal ‘dream’ holiday in New Zealand. The charming down-to-earth tone makes you smile and it&#8217;s what tips this from being your bog standard tourism ad into a really nice entertaining story that will make more than the Aussies want to visit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, throughout the dream, the pair take part in a range of tourist experiences, such as fine dining, jet boating, cycling through a vineyard, and star gazing in a hot tub, simple and effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s titled <strong><a href="https://www.newzealand.com/au/campaign/stop-dreaming-and-go/">‘Stop Dreaming about New Zealand and Go’</a>. </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="594" src="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Picture-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2136" srcset="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Picture-1.jpg 800w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Picture-1-768x570.jpg 768w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Picture-1-600x446.jpg 600w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Picture-1-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Wow, that was intense.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The rebooted Kinsale Sharks 2018 was as raucous and inspirational as ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gone was the infamous sit down Gala Awards Ceremony (Bloody right that’s Trevor Beattie at the next table), and instead the festival organisers served up a cracking lineup of speakers, including the legendary Mark Denton and Nils Leonard &#8211; to name just two.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It wasn’t Mark Denton’s iconic outdoor work for Nike and Wrangler that stuck in the mind (that was already firmly fixed – Michael Jordan versus Isaac Newton anyone?), it was that when a great idea takes shape in his<br />
 imagination he doesn’t rest until it finds form in the world. Here’s a man who believes that a great idea shouldn’t die before it’s had the chance to live. To hell with the whim of a client lacking faith in a thought, Mark Denton makes up for it in abundance. And when his belief in an idea’s potential is harnessed with unwavering self-belief he creates work that transcends its initial iteration.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That same creative drive, one that’s reluctant to bend to a higher authority other than the work itself, was also a theme of Nils Leonard’s talk. Uncommon is founded on the principal of only working with brands that share a common belief to ‘make a difference’ in the world, and if those brands are in short supply then the team at Uncommon will create them, such as Halo, the world’s first compostable coffee capsule.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He passionately expressed the need for agencies to be stronger about backing their own ideas instead of waiting for approval. It reminded me of a Seth Godin quote that what makes someone a professional is that they can<br />
 be unsupervised, but instead we are all too guilty of waiting for approval before acting on our better instincts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And when you follow your better instincts you will uncover great work. What are the things that stir you? What makes you angry? What do you care about more than anything else. What pisses you off? These are the questions Nils Leonard asks of himself and it’s reflected in his work. Like Mark Denton, it demonstrates a level of personal investment in the work that elevates it beyond the ordinary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like any creative work, its merits, or lack of, can be debated a million different ways from an infinite number of perspectives, but one thing that is irrefutable is an aura of passion radiating from work that’s born of a deep personal investment. That care does shine through.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It also shone through in terms of the work that was recognised by the judges this year. Of course, like at any advertising awards show, that recognition was as predictable as it was unpredictable, with Golds for already iconic work including Wieden+Kennedy’s Nike Nothing beats a Londoner film, Energy BBDO’s Prescribed to Death campaign, as well as the beautifully crafted film work by Nexus for Wimbledon and the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Irish advertising more than held its own on the International stage, and at Boys + Girls we were delighted to take home 7 Sharks for a myriad of different clients, including Energia, Irish Heart Foundation, ŠKODA and Three.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But as I absorbed all the wonderful work I was reminded of the fact that while the briefs come and go, as we move quickly from one campaign to the next, and while this months work is on air and we’re already thinking about next year, there’s one constant – you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the great copywriter, Paul Fishlock, once said: “If you don’t enjoy writing it, you can sure as fuck bet nobody will enjoy reading it.” So don’t just do your job, throw yourself into it. Invest every ounce of your being, and leave nothing behind knowing you will resurface in the work, and find new form in unexpected and brilliant ways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Shane Casey</strong>, Head of Digital</em></p>
<p><strong>Innovation is a much-abused word in advertising. However Cannes Lions defines itself as not just an advertising awards, but as a “Festival of Creativity”. </strong></p>
<p>There’s a home (and a category) for every type of creative thinking; from advertising to entertainment, charitable to commercial, analogue to digital. With the best of the best from around the world to choose from, I was intrigued to see how the juries would define “innovation”.</p>
<p>The cynic in me expected to see the latest technologies rolled out as <strong>“world firsts”</strong>, and there certainly was that in spades. Spotify deployed robot sculptors to immortalise rappers, TD bank created an ad in the blockchain (that literally no-one will ever see) and IBM’s Watson picked up more metal than a scrapyard crane. If something could be 3D scanned, 3D printed or recreated in virtual reality, it was — from Edvard Munch’s paintbrushes to Billy Corgan’s hairless head.</p>
<p>However, it was encouraging to see a clear bias from a lot of the juries toward “real innovation” rather than tokenistic technology. I spent a lot of my time in Cannes at the ‘Inside the Jury Room’ sessions, where jurors would discuss their favourite winners from their category and reveal the main topics of debate and discussion in the jury rooms. The Innovation, Digital Craft, Creative Data and Mobile juries all repeated the same mantra — they were much more interested in the creative application of existing technologies than first-mover uses of new technologies.</p>
<p>For example, with <strong>‘ATMs that Listen’</strong> the CommonWealth Bank in Australia repurposed their network of over 4000 ATMs nationwide to not just handle banking transactions, but also to survey their customers. With over 1.2 million responses to date (second only to the Australian census), Commonwealth Bank have made a powerful business tool out of their existing infrastructure.</p>

</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_-jg_zOtmo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the Digital Craft jury raved about <strong>‘Touching Masterpieces’</strong> that employed haptic gloves, around since the 90s, to enable the blind to <strong>‘see’</strong> sculptural masterpieces at the National Gallery in Prague. While badged as the <strong>‘World’s first VR experience for the blind’</strong> its charm and innovation still lay in an unconventional use of long-standing tech.</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VuPGny-cIik?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the simple poster, the last thing you’d expect in Innovation categories, was reinvented as <strong>‘The Dissolving Posters’</strong> to combat the spread of Zika and Dengue fever in the Brazilian favelas. Made of rice paper, they’d dissolve in the rain and distribute a powerful insecticide to kill mosquito larvae before they even mature.</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWqnsUIM0zE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And possibly my favourite piece of work, <strong>‘My Line’</strong>, for the Colombian Ministry of Communications and Information, brought free access to Google to Colombia’s poorest and remotest areas via the phone. They created a toll-free number (<strong>‘6000913’</strong>, think about it&#8230;) that Colombians could call from their phones. Their search queries and results were handled in real-time by Google’s voice assistant. For a country with severely limited internet access, it suddenly gave access to Google’s wealth of information to 99.3% of the population. Such an ingeniously simple repurposing of the phone that the juries had to spend a long time ensuring it hadn’t been done before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approach of assigning new tasks to readily available tools, technologies and objects around us was a real inspiration to me. We’re surrounded by things that we assume to only have the predefined purpose we’re accustomed to. If we can challenge our own preconceptions of the functional limitations of our surroundings or organisations, we have everything we need to deliver real world innovation&#8230; without a huge R&amp;D budget.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Rory Hamilton</strong>, Executive Creative Director</em></p>
<p>When I was a kid, back in the 1980s, the Harlem Globetrotters came to Ireland. It was unbelievably exciting seeing the best basketball players in the world play in front of my eyes. I was yet to figure out that, hailing from County Wicklow, my chances at NBA stardom were slim (I will now begrudgingly admit that where I was from wasn’t what finally stood between me and NBA glory). So when the Harlem Globetrotters took to the court, I was mesmerised. These were men who could do somersault slam dunks! They could do no wrong. But then a niggling question arose. Why didn’t the Globetrotters win the NBA every year? Surely they were the best players — they had the best trick shots.</p>
<p>Why didn’t they play for The Bulls, The Heat, even The Knicks? It took me years to figure out that trick shots aren’t basketball. Trick shots are impressive, amazing even. But, like me, they have no place in the game. Trick shots are something else entirely.</p>
<p>I hadn’t thought about the Harlem Globetrotters in 30 years, but as I stood in the halls at Cannes looking at the amazing work on the walls I thought about little else. The campaigns on display are mind bogglingly clever, razor sharp insights married to perfect <strong>“why the hell didn’t I think of it?”</strong> creative ideas.</p>
<p>Judging by the work, marketing has had a hell of a year. I saw campaigns for brands designed to cure cancer, end homelessness, cure colour blindness, end abuse, clear our oceans of plastic, protect endangered species, rebuild our rain forests, fix the migrant crisis, end gender imbalance in business, help deaf people to hear, cure aids and prevent suicide. Not to mind three campaigns designed to help ALS sufferers to speak.</p>
<p>We also saw campaigns which brought Louis XIV, the painter Edvard Munch, JFK and the entire Chapecoense football team back from the dead, each using data to augment creativity. Each of these ideas were brilliant. Each tackled an issue that deserves more attention and requires brands to dig in and help out. Every one a slam dunk, or rather, a somersault slam dunk.</p>
<p>What was missing were the campaigns advertising a new mortgage rate, a new mobile phone price plan, a new model of car, a new product formulation or a new offer. Put simply, there was very little basketball on display.</p>
<p>If this seems like a criticism of Cannes, it isn’t meant to be. Cannes is where the best agencies, the best clients and the best brands gather. It is the standard. Instead this is meant as a lesson in what it takes to win.</p>
<p>As brands, we need to stop thinking of Cannes as a game that we know and accept that it is something else entirely. A game with completely different rules. It’s a game of trick shots, and trick shots take practice. Endless practice. Winning takes dedicating time and budget to this other game. We need to stop thinking like basketball players and start thinking like the Globetrotters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Avril Delaney</strong>, Copywriter</em></p>
<p>A big takeout of Cannes 2018, from the talks to the winners, was the importance of creating culturally potent work. Brands have the power to not only impact culture, but shift it entirely. Acknowledging the context in which you’re creating work is important. Our work doesn’t go out into a vacuum. Those that tap into cultural insights, or contribute to culture, get noticed.</p>
<p>In <strong>‘Exploration of New Creative Processes’</strong>, Nick Barham, Chief Strategy officer at Backslash, posited that <strong>“culture is the competition”</strong>. Backslash, TBWA’s<strong> “cultural editorial arm”</strong>, was created in 2017 as a dedicated resource to discover ways in which TBWA can <strong>“play in culture”</strong>. According to Barham, we either create work that has cultural value in some way, be it offering entertainment or contributing to culture change, or risk losing relevance.</p>
<p>In one of the jury room sessions, a jury member commented that they sought out campaigns that not only captured the cultural zeitgeist, but solved cultural problems. However, they warned that for issues that have already been brought to light, bringing awareness to them is pointless. A solution to the problem must be offered.</p>
<p>They commented on the power of a brand to change the cultural conversation and reminded the audience that brands are living in a world of transformation. They cited Nissan’s <strong>‘She Drives’</strong> as a piece of work that didn’t simply comment on culture, but aided the cultural shift that was already happening in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>This year Saudi Arabia overturned its ban on female drivers and, according to the jury, Nissan helped <strong>“smooth the cultural change”</strong> with their campaign. That’s not to say that all <strong>“culturally potent”</strong> work must be worthy and purposeful. You can contribute to culture by simply making people laugh. “<strong>There’s a place for entertainment”</strong>, said Leila Fataar during the ‘Unskippable Craft’ panel. “<strong>You don’t need to save the world, but you </strong><strong>do need to contribute”</strong>.</p>
<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UzYN0hPWcLA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being culturally relevant doesn’t mean just shoe-horning celebrities and influencers into your ads. In Campaign, James Murphy, writing about Cannes 2018, critiqued that, <strong>“there was still that strange obsession with celebrity — remember the time when advertising used to make culture rather than desperately try and attach </strong><strong>itself to it?”</strong></p>
<p>That being said, this was exactly what brought success to Wieden and Kennedy for their Nike Campaign, <strong>‘Nothing Beats a Londoner’</strong>, which took home the Grand Prix in the inaugural Social and Influencer category. Jury president: Mark D’Arcy, VP, Chief Creative Officer, Facebook Creative Shop, said, <strong>“The way this work was constructed really demonstrates how culture is shaped.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mEB1C59hCvs?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cultural potency can solve business problems, not just societal ones. Work was proven to have cultural impact if it earned attention, earned media, and earned influence, proving that cultural potency results in creative effectiveness. In fact, culturally significant work featured heavily in the Creative Effectiveness category, with campaigns including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVWUlWEfJ1k">Savlon: Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IY77rr3nP4">adidas Originals: Original is Never Finished</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iPWCeKz4_c">PEDIGREE: Child Replacement Programme</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFCAd9ygmTM">Amnesty International: The Refugee Nation</a> all getting metal. Proving that being culturally relevant has business rewards.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, advertising is about the practical application of creativity. We’re an industry of problem solvers. For us, there’s a requirement to solve a business problem, not just a societal one.</p>
<p>So, how can we produce more culturally potent work? There’s some obvious ways. By paying attention to what’s going on in our society, being observant of culture, and by being open to being part of the conversation and cognizant of our ability to shape culture itself.</p>
<p>As advised by one panel that featured the creators of Tide’s Super Bowl cultural home run: <strong>‘Look for the next open space and occupy it.’</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Caroline Keogh</strong>, Senior Account Director</em></p>
<p>The Glass Lions, or The Lions for Change, celebrate ideas intended to change the world. The category awards work that set out to positively impact ingrained gender inequality, imbalance or injustice.</p>
<p>The Jury President this year was very fitting — the inimitable Madonna Badger, Founder &amp; CCO of Badger &amp; Winters, a purpose-driven U.S. agency that are on a mission to rewrite how women are portrayed in advertising.</p>
<p>This year, Madonna and her jury awarded 11 Glass Lions, from a shortlist of 27. Here are the key sub-themes that featured within the work, along with examples that endeavoured for change in this space.</p>
<h2>Gender inequality in sports<span style="color: #f03694;">+</span>gaming</h2>
<p>Nike’s <strong>‘The Lioness Crest’</strong> celebrated Dutch women’s unique attitude to and identity within sport, designing the Dutch women’s football team their own unique lioness crest.</p>
<p><strong>#MyGameMyName</strong>, Telefonica/Vivo Brazil’s online gaming initiative addressed online sexual harassment in the gaming world by highlighting the issue amongst the wider gaming community.</p>
<p><strong>‘Sisters in Sweat’</strong> by Gatorade featured a powerful message from tennis legend Serena Williams to her daughter and all schoolgirls about the wonders of team sports.</p>
<h2>Motherhood<span style="color: #f03694;">+</span>injustice</h2>
<p><strong>The Pregnancy Pause</strong>’s LinkedIn initiative helped mothers avoid CV gaps which have a negative impact on their employment prospects.</p>
<p><strong>#StandByToughMoms,</strong> All Out’s endeavour to bring the hidden stresses of tough Indian moms into the open and ignite a national conversation around the subject.</p>
<p>Baby Dove’s <strong>‘Beautifully Real Moms’</strong> shouted loud that being a real mom is so much more beautiful than being perfect.</p>
<h2>Violence against women</h2>
<p>A really active territory this year with a plethora of entries seeking to tackle this issue. Highlights included UNICEF’s <strong>‘The Worst Soap Opera’</strong> which won Gold and highlighted the Dominican Republic’s child marriage epidemic through the medium of the nationally popular TV soap opera.</p>
<p><strong>‘The Dress for Respect’</strong> from Schweppes Brazil, an initiative to encourage open and public conversation about sexual harassment.</p>
<p>The <strong>‘Rape Tax’</strong> by the National Organization for Victim Assistance which brought to life the reality of rape victims in the U.S. getting hit with medical bills following their attacks.</p>
<h2>Female opportunity<span style="color: #f03694;">+</span>development</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Technical School brought a shift to the mentality of Indian society towards the girl child and the patriarchal practice of calling daughters ‘<strong>beta’</strong>, an Indian word for son.</p>
<p>Also out of India, the Times of India’s <strong>‘No Conditions Apply’</strong>, which also won Gold, is a platform which works towards better representation of women in India and sees the newspaper identify opportunities for intervention in Bengali culture where they can be a true catalyst of positive and progressive change in the U.S. <br />
 as part of GE’s Balance.</p>
<p>The Equation initiative, which aims to hire, promote and retain more women in science and technology, created <strong>‘Unseen Stars’</strong>, an activation that featured live projection mapping in Grand Central Station depicting 12 pioneering female scientists.</p>
<h2>Menstrual stigma</h2>
<p><strong>‘Blood Normal’</strong> by Essity challenged the stigma and taboo that surrounds periods by showing them as a normal part of life. Shockingly they are the first menstrual product brand to show period blood that looks like actual blood (not bright blue, not clinical-looking).</p>
<p>The <strong>‘Tampon Tax Off’</strong> from Tesco, saw the brand removing the tax on sanitary wear to positively impact millions of women across the U.K. because they don’t believe women should be taxed for being women.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Stayfree’s <strong>‘Project Free Period’</strong> identified an opportunity to use periods to normalise the lives of Indian commercial sex trade workers by providing them with skills that could generate future sustainable incomes.</p>
<h2>The Grand Prix winner?</h2>
<p>Blood Normal from Essity. The campaign had a PR reach of <br />
 over 4.5 billion, a 72% positive reaction to the work, and the brand’s share of social voice rose from 37% to 90%. Influencers and collaborators got on board and spread the blood normal message and by gaining traction in news and culture, the campaign found its way onto the television stations they were originally banned from. A worthy winner.</p>
<p>Seeing this brave work at Cannes, work that was gallant enough to use what we do on a daily basis to tackle societal issues, was a great reminder of the power and potential of our industry — a reminder that these awards are not about back-patting, but actual transformative change <br />
 on a global scale.</p>
