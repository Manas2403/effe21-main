<p>Drowning is the second biggest cause of accidental deaths for children in Ireland and the risk grew significantly during the Covid-19 pandemic, as more Irish people were visiting Irish beaches. This was caused by mix of unusually good weather along with the closure of supervised swimming pools and the restriction of international travel. So, for <a href="https://www.swimireland.ie/news/drowning-prevention-week-resources">Drowning Prevention Week</a> we created a hard-hitting radio spot that brought the perils of not paying attention to a child in the water into sharp focus for parents and guardians.</p>



<p>This 60-second spot takes a simple phrase that all Irish parents are used to hearing on a almost daily basis, and imbues it with new meaning. The spot starts off happy with a little girl playing in the water shouting,&nbsp;“LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!”&nbsp;She repeats this phrase over and over again, as she gets into more difficulty. Her cries go from happy and carefree to desperate and terrified.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The ad was sound designed by <a href="http://www.mutiny.ie/">Mutiny Studios</a> and recorded on location on Sandymount Beach and Marion College swimming pool. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Christmas, we opened the World’s first Connected Restaurant for Three Ireland + Samsung Ireland, giving some lucky families the chance to have Christmas dinner in Dublin with the ones they miss in Sydney. </p>
<p>Our unique pop up brought families split between Ireland and Australia together for Christmas, despite the 17,209km distance and 11-hour time difference between them. Demand for bookings at the restaurant was exceptionally high, with enough table requests to fill the 4-day pop up for 3-months straight. Watch the best moments from The Connected Restaurant: </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on Three’s ‘Make it count’ proposition, we embraced the surreal, featuring a mum who’s stuck in work, bouncing with her little girl on the Three Ireland Network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking about the commercial, Kris Clarkin, creative director said, “We wanted to create a brand film that was visually striking but also has an emotional heart. All You Can Eat Data means Three Ireland’s customers never have to miss a moment again. This film reflects a very real scenario in a very surreal way. It’s a fun spot that helps a working parent to be in two places at the same time.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our latest work for Amnesty International highlights the plight of oppressed parents and children, and raises the question of whether America can still claim to be the land of the free. Our emotional reaction to what’s unfolding demanded an immediate reaction, which is why we created this radio ad for Amnesty International in the space of 12 hours.</p>
<p>We hope it gets the attention it demands and increases support for the amazing work that Amnesty does. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are delighted to announce the continuation of our award-winning partnership with Three for a further 3 years. The extended contract will increase the scope of the our remit and will &#8211; for the first time &#8211;  include Three’s digital and content creation work.</p>
<p><em>“We&#8217;re absolutely delighted to have agreed a three-year extension to our contract with Three. The body of work we&#8217;ve created since we first began working together is testament to a really strong client agency relationship. Our collective and fervent belief lies in the power and importance of creativity to deliver great commercial results. Three wants &#8211; and demand -great work and we&#8217;re pleased to now have an even wider multi-annual brief to deliver it for them.” &#8211; </em>Pat Stephenson</p>
<p>We were initially appointed by Three Ireland to handle their creative account in January 2013 after a competitive pitch. Since that time, We’ve helped integrate the o2 brand into Three and developed their new brand positioning which manifested in the launch of the Make It Count campaign last year.</p>
<p>Working together, Three have become the most creatively award winning client in the country &#8211; alongside their 3 ADFX wins to date. An enviable body of much lauded work includes the campaigns Three Little Words, The Loneliest Whale,  All it Takes, the Girl in the Cloud and #thecallup.</p>
<p>Just last year Boys and Girls successfully pitched to handle Three’s experiential business with activations at the Longitude and Electric Picnic festivals.</p>
<p>Elaine Carey, Chief Commercial Officer, Three, said:<br />
 <em>“Our brand is all about facilitating a better connected life for our customers through our market leading plans, incredible sponsorships, as well as our roll-out of Ireland’s biggest and most advanced 4G network. For the next three years we’re looking forward to working with Boys &amp; Girls to continue to bring all of this to life by creating more market leading advertising and brand experiences. We believe that this work will deliver new levels of active engagement with our customers and help drive our growth plans, propelling the Three brand upwards.” </em></p>
