										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Shane Casey</strong>, Head of Digital</em></p>
<p><strong>Innovation is a much-abused word in advertising. However Cannes Lions defines itself as not just an advertising awards, but as a “Festival of Creativity”. </strong></p>
<p>There’s a home (and a category) for every type of creative thinking; from advertising to entertainment, charitable to commercial, analogue to digital. With the best of the best from around the world to choose from, I was intrigued to see how the juries would define “innovation”.</p>
<p>The cynic in me expected to see the latest technologies rolled out as <strong>“world firsts”</strong>, and there certainly was that in spades. Spotify deployed robot sculptors to immortalise rappers, TD bank created an ad in the blockchain (that literally no-one will ever see) and IBM’s Watson picked up more metal than a scrapyard crane. If something could be 3D scanned, 3D printed or recreated in virtual reality, it was — from Edvard Munch’s paintbrushes to Billy Corgan’s hairless head.</p>
<p>However, it was encouraging to see a clear bias from a lot of the juries toward “real innovation” rather than tokenistic technology. I spent a lot of my time in Cannes at the ‘Inside the Jury Room’ sessions, where jurors would discuss their favourite winners from their category and reveal the main topics of debate and discussion in the jury rooms. The Innovation, Digital Craft, Creative Data and Mobile juries all repeated the same mantra — they were much more interested in the creative application of existing technologies than first-mover uses of new technologies.</p>
<p>For example, with <strong>‘ATMs that Listen’</strong> the CommonWealth Bank in Australia repurposed their network of over 4000 ATMs nationwide to not just handle banking transactions, but also to survey their customers. With over 1.2 million responses to date (second only to the Australian census), Commonwealth Bank have made a powerful business tool out of their existing infrastructure.</p>

</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_-jg_zOtmo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the Digital Craft jury raved about <strong>‘Touching Masterpieces’</strong> that employed haptic gloves, around since the 90s, to enable the blind to <strong>‘see’</strong> sculptural masterpieces at the National Gallery in Prague. While badged as the <strong>‘World’s first VR experience for the blind’</strong> its charm and innovation still lay in an unconventional use of long-standing tech.</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VuPGny-cIik?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the simple poster, the last thing you’d expect in Innovation categories, was reinvented as <strong>‘The Dissolving Posters’</strong> to combat the spread of Zika and Dengue fever in the Brazilian favelas. Made of rice paper, they’d dissolve in the rain and distribute a powerful insecticide to kill mosquito larvae before they even mature.</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWqnsUIM0zE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And possibly my favourite piece of work, <strong>‘My Line’</strong>, for the Colombian Ministry of Communications and Information, brought free access to Google to Colombia’s poorest and remotest areas via the phone. They created a toll-free number (<strong>‘6000913’</strong>, think about it&#8230;) that Colombians could call from their phones. Their search queries and results were handled in real-time by Google’s voice assistant. For a country with severely limited internet access, it suddenly gave access to Google’s wealth of information to 99.3% of the population. Such an ingeniously simple repurposing of the phone that the juries had to spend a long time ensuring it hadn’t been done before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approach of assigning new tasks to readily available tools, technologies and objects around us was a real inspiration to me. We’re surrounded by things that we assume to only have the predefined purpose we’re accustomed to. If we can challenge our own preconceptions of the functional limitations of our surroundings or organisations, we have everything we need to deliver real world innovation&#8230; without a huge R&amp;D budget.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Rory Hamilton</strong>, Executive Creative Director</em></p>
<p>When I was a kid, back in the 1980s, the Harlem Globetrotters came to Ireland. It was unbelievably exciting seeing the best basketball players in the world play in front of my eyes. I was yet to figure out that, hailing from County Wicklow, my chances at NBA stardom were slim (I will now begrudgingly admit that where I was from wasn’t what finally stood between me and NBA glory). So when the Harlem Globetrotters took to the court, I was mesmerised. These were men who could do somersault slam dunks! They could do no wrong. But then a niggling question arose. Why didn’t the Globetrotters win the NBA every year? Surely they were the best players — they had the best trick shots.</p>
<p>Why didn’t they play for The Bulls, The Heat, even The Knicks? It took me years to figure out that trick shots aren’t basketball. Trick shots are impressive, amazing even. But, like me, they have no place in the game. Trick shots are something else entirely.</p>
<p>I hadn’t thought about the Harlem Globetrotters in 30 years, but as I stood in the halls at Cannes looking at the amazing work on the walls I thought about little else. The campaigns on display are mind bogglingly clever, razor sharp insights married to perfect <strong>“why the hell didn’t I think of it?”</strong> creative ideas.</p>
<p>Judging by the work, marketing has had a hell of a year. I saw campaigns for brands designed to cure cancer, end homelessness, cure colour blindness, end abuse, clear our oceans of plastic, protect endangered species, rebuild our rain forests, fix the migrant crisis, end gender imbalance in business, help deaf people to hear, cure aids and prevent suicide. Not to mind three campaigns designed to help ALS sufferers to speak.</p>
<p>We also saw campaigns which brought Louis XIV, the painter Edvard Munch, JFK and the entire Chapecoense football team back from the dead, each using data to augment creativity. Each of these ideas were brilliant. Each tackled an issue that deserves more attention and requires brands to dig in and help out. Every one a slam dunk, or rather, a somersault slam dunk.</p>
<p>What was missing were the campaigns advertising a new mortgage rate, a new mobile phone price plan, a new model of car, a new product formulation or a new offer. Put simply, there was very little basketball on display.</p>
<p>If this seems like a criticism of Cannes, it isn’t meant to be. Cannes is where the best agencies, the best clients and the best brands gather. It is the standard. Instead this is meant as a lesson in what it takes to win.</p>
<p>As brands, we need to stop thinking of Cannes as a game that we know and accept that it is something else entirely. A game with completely different rules. It’s a game of trick shots, and trick shots take practice. Endless practice. Winning takes dedicating time and budget to this other game. We need to stop thinking like basketball players and start thinking like the Globetrotters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Avril Delaney</strong>, Copywriter</em></p>
<p>A big takeout of Cannes 2018, from the talks to the winners, was the importance of creating culturally potent work. Brands have the power to not only impact culture, but shift it entirely. Acknowledging the context in which you’re creating work is important. Our work doesn’t go out into a vacuum. Those that tap into cultural insights, or contribute to culture, get noticed.</p>
<p>In <strong>‘Exploration of New Creative Processes’</strong>, Nick Barham, Chief Strategy officer at Backslash, posited that <strong>“culture is the competition”</strong>. Backslash, TBWA’s<strong> “cultural editorial arm”</strong>, was created in 2017 as a dedicated resource to discover ways in which TBWA can <strong>“play in culture”</strong>. According to Barham, we either create work that has cultural value in some way, be it offering entertainment or contributing to culture change, or risk losing relevance.</p>
<p>In one of the jury room sessions, a jury member commented that they sought out campaigns that not only captured the cultural zeitgeist, but solved cultural problems. However, they warned that for issues that have already been brought to light, bringing awareness to them is pointless. A solution to the problem must be offered.</p>
<p>They commented on the power of a brand to change the cultural conversation and reminded the audience that brands are living in a world of transformation. They cited Nissan’s <strong>‘She Drives’</strong> as a piece of work that didn’t simply comment on culture, but aided the cultural shift that was already happening in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>This year Saudi Arabia overturned its ban on female drivers and, according to the jury, Nissan helped <strong>“smooth the cultural change”</strong> with their campaign. That’s not to say that all <strong>“culturally potent”</strong> work must be worthy and purposeful. You can contribute to culture by simply making people laugh. “<strong>There’s a place for entertainment”</strong>, said Leila Fataar during the ‘Unskippable Craft’ panel. “<strong>You don’t need to save the world, but you </strong><strong>do need to contribute”</strong>.</p>
<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UzYN0hPWcLA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being culturally relevant doesn’t mean just shoe-horning celebrities and influencers into your ads. In Campaign, James Murphy, writing about Cannes 2018, critiqued that, <strong>“there was still that strange obsession with celebrity — remember the time when advertising used to make culture rather than desperately try and attach </strong><strong>itself to it?”</strong></p>
<p>That being said, this was exactly what brought success to Wieden and Kennedy for their Nike Campaign, <strong>‘Nothing Beats a Londoner’</strong>, which took home the Grand Prix in the inaugural Social and Influencer category. Jury president: Mark D’Arcy, VP, Chief Creative Officer, Facebook Creative Shop, said, <strong>“The way this work was constructed really demonstrates how culture is shaped.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mEB1C59hCvs?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cultural potency can solve business problems, not just societal ones. Work was proven to have cultural impact if it earned attention, earned media, and earned influence, proving that cultural potency results in creative effectiveness. In fact, culturally significant work featured heavily in the Creative Effectiveness category, with campaigns including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVWUlWEfJ1k">Savlon: Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IY77rr3nP4">adidas Originals: Original is Never Finished</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iPWCeKz4_c">PEDIGREE: Child Replacement Programme</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFCAd9ygmTM">Amnesty International: The Refugee Nation</a> all getting metal. Proving that being culturally relevant has business rewards.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, advertising is about the practical application of creativity. We’re an industry of problem solvers. For us, there’s a requirement to solve a business problem, not just a societal one.</p>
<p>So, how can we produce more culturally potent work? There’s some obvious ways. By paying attention to what’s going on in our society, being observant of culture, and by being open to being part of the conversation and cognizant of our ability to shape culture itself.</p>
<p>As advised by one panel that featured the creators of Tide’s Super Bowl cultural home run: <strong>‘Look for the next open space and occupy it.’</strong></p>

<p>The Glass Lions, or The Lions for Change, celebrate ideas intended to change the world. The category awards work that set out to positively impact ingrained gender inequality, imbalance or injustice.</p>
<p>The Jury President this year was very fitting — the inimitable Madonna Badger, Founder &amp; CCO of Badger &amp; Winters, a purpose-driven U.S. agency that are on a mission to rewrite how women are portrayed in advertising.</p>
<p>This year, Madonna and her jury awarded 11 Glass Lions, from a shortlist of 27. Here are the key sub-themes that featured within the work, along with examples that endeavoured for change in this space.</p>
<h2>Gender inequality in sports<span style="color: #f03694;">+</span>gaming</h2>
<p>Nike’s <strong>‘The Lioness Crest’</strong> celebrated Dutch women’s unique attitude to and identity within sport, designing the Dutch women’s football team their own unique lioness crest.</p>
<p><strong>#MyGameMyName</strong>, Telefonica/Vivo Brazil’s online gaming initiative addressed online sexual harassment in the gaming world by highlighting the issue amongst the wider gaming community.</p>
<p><strong>‘Sisters in Sweat’</strong> by Gatorade featured a powerful message from tennis legend Serena Williams to her daughter and all schoolgirls about the wonders of team sports.</p>
<h2>Motherhood<span style="color: #f03694;">+</span>injustice</h2>
<p><strong>The Pregnancy Pause</strong>’s LinkedIn initiative helped mothers avoid CV gaps which have a negative impact on their employment prospects.</p>
<p><strong>#StandByToughMoms,</strong> All Out’s endeavour to bring the hidden stresses of tough Indian moms into the open and ignite a national conversation around the subject.</p>
<p>Baby Dove’s <strong>‘Beautifully Real Moms’</strong> shouted loud that being a real mom is so much more beautiful than being perfect.</p>
<h2>Violence against women</h2>
<p>A really active territory this year with a plethora of entries seeking to tackle this issue. Highlights included UNICEF’s <strong>‘The Worst Soap Opera’</strong> which won Gold and highlighted the Dominican Republic’s child marriage epidemic through the medium of the nationally popular TV soap opera.</p>
<p><strong>‘The Dress for Respect’</strong> from Schweppes Brazil, an initiative to encourage open and public conversation about sexual harassment.</p>
<p>The <strong>‘Rape Tax’</strong> by the National Organization for Victim Assistance which brought to life the reality of rape victims in the U.S. getting hit with medical bills following their attacks.</p>
<h2>Female opportunity<span style="color: #f03694;">+</span>development</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Technical School brought a shift to the mentality of Indian society towards the girl child and the patriarchal practice of calling daughters ‘<strong>beta’</strong>, an Indian word for son.</p>
<p>Also out of India, the Times of India’s <strong>‘No Conditions Apply’</strong>, which also won Gold, is a platform which works towards better representation of women in India and sees the newspaper identify opportunities for intervention in Bengali culture where they can be a true catalyst of positive and progressive change in the U.S. <br />
 as part of GE’s Balance.</p>
<p>The Equation initiative, which aims to hire, promote and retain more women in science and technology, created <strong>‘Unseen Stars’</strong>, an activation that featured live projection mapping in Grand Central Station depicting 12 pioneering female scientists.</p>
<h2>Menstrual stigma</h2>
<p><strong>‘Blood Normal’</strong> by Essity challenged the stigma and taboo that surrounds periods by showing them as a normal part of life. Shockingly they are the first menstrual product brand to show period blood that looks like actual blood (not bright blue, not clinical-looking).</p>
<p>The <strong>‘Tampon Tax Off’</strong> from Tesco, saw the brand removing the tax on sanitary wear to positively impact millions of women across the U.K. because they don’t believe women should be taxed for being women.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Stayfree’s <strong>‘Project Free Period’</strong> identified an opportunity to use periods to normalise the lives of Indian commercial sex trade workers by providing them with skills that could generate future sustainable incomes.</p>
<h2>The Grand Prix winner?</h2>
<p>Blood Normal from Essity. The campaign had a PR reach of <br />
 over 4.5 billion, a 72% positive reaction to the work, and the brand’s share of social voice rose from 37% to 90%. Influencers and collaborators got on board and spread the blood normal message and by gaining traction in news and culture, the campaign found its way onto the television stations they were originally banned from. A worthy winner.</p>
<p>Seeing this brave work at Cannes, work that was gallant enough to use what we do on a daily basis to tackle societal issues, was a great reminder of the power and potential of our industry — a reminder that these awards are not about back-patting, but actual transformative change <br />
 on a global scale.</p>

<p>At Cannes 2018, seasoned veterans seemed to be relieved that the main attraction was not another launch or tech announcement, but rather, a return to focusing on creativity. Speaking in AdAge this week, PHD Media worldwide strategy and planning director Mark Holden said he thought it was beneficial that Cannes was <strong>“a bit smaller this year,” with “a refocus on what’s really important, which is creativity. You felt that focus on creativity was getting quite marginalised,” and “that the creative element was there but was just getting buried under everything else.”</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, there now appears to be an understanding that new tech works best in the guise of ‘as well as’, rather than <strong>‘instead of’</strong>. That it is best used as a device to tell that great story, not be the great story in itself. The best work I saw relied on the time-immune attributes of great heart and great craft. Yes, sometimes, great tech helped achieve the end goal, but it wasn’t the achievement in itself.</p>
<p>Most of the conversations around production were on the themes of collaboration and credibility. Authenticity seemed to be the word you just could not escape from watching the work and listening to the talks. Of course, wanting to appear credible or authentic is not new, but there appeared to be a genuine belief among brands and filmmakers that this would be a more rewarding pursuit.</p>
<p>My favourite talk of the week was held on a small stage on Wednesday morning. <strong>‘Execution and the Auteur’</strong> focused on collaboration and executional excellence in content creation. Milak Vitthal, a director from The Corner Shop in LA and one of the contributors on stage, discussed his film <strong>‘The Talk’</strong> for P&amp;G.</p>
<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3s20ePvTaME?rel=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Produced as part of their <strong>‘Black is Beautiful’</strong> campaign, it’s a delicately judged film which explores the history of racial bias in the US, by showing how black parents explain to their children the difficulties they may face growing up in a world of prejudice.</p>
<p>‘The Talk’ went on to win a Grand Prix in Film for Malik. What I loved about this was how the filmmakers did not dance around the issue or ignore the political landscape. One of the scenes, showing a learner driver and her mum, when talking about being stopped by police, includes the line, “<strong>This is </strong><br />
 <strong>not about you getting a ticket, this is about you not coming home”.</strong> No swerving there.</p>
<p>Also scoring big, winning a Grand Prix in Film Craft for the director James Rouse, was the film ‘Hope’, for the International Committee of the Red Cross, which was produced to raise awareness of the attacks that hospitals and health workers suffer in areas of conflict.</p>
<p>The EP of the film, Pablo Garcia Acon, in discussing authenticity in the film said: <strong>“We ensured all of the production elements; the location, the actors, their acting, the car… oozed reality from all their pores. If at any point in the film there was something </strong><strong>that took the audience out of that reality, we would have failed </strong><strong>in our job.”</strong></p>
<p>Shooting this from the point of view of a father rushing his wounded daughter to a hospital for treatment takes this to another level. I won’t spoil it. I defy you to not be moved by this story.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thunder Road</strong>, directed by Jim Cummings. A 12-minute short, directed by Kim Cummings, that is brilliantly described as <strong>‘an American police officer eulogises his mother at her funeral by singing and dancing to the Bruce Springsteen song’</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, it is that bonkers as a premise, but beautifully bonkers. It’s all done in a single shot, which gives you an insight into how the wonderful casting, script and performances elevate it into something very special.</p>
<p>So, the good news. We don’t need the new shiny toy to make great work. New tech may help us get there, but it shouldn’t be the point of the journey itself. However, we do need to be bold and brave in holding true to our belief in the power of creativity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Sarah Sherry</strong>, Head of Digital Business</em></p>
<p>Another day, another talk, another buzz word — Transformation, or rather <strong>‘Transformation at Speed’</strong> was discussed by impressive advertising industry leaders from R/GA. They spoke about ‘Transformation at Speed’, and how the advertising industry as we know it is being disrupted and currently undergoing a critical challenge — fewer people than ever are spending time on ad-supported content.</p>
<p><strong>“Transformation has to happen quickly. It’s going to turn out that speed is going to be the great differentiator for whether or not companies survive going into the future,”</strong> said R/GA’s EVP Global Chief Strategy Officer Barry Wacksman.</p>
<p>Hence, building brands through ads has been more challenging than ever. R/GA’s SVP Strategy in the US, Jess Greenwood said, <strong>“The amount of time that we spend consuming content in places that are ad supported is going down. And this should be an enormous red flag for everybody.”</strong></p>
<p>The real question is, how can we go beyond advertising, and into creativity, in order to help companies transform. It is after all the Cannes Lions, Festival of Creativity — not advertising. According to Jess, advertising still has a vital role to play, but not the starring one. If that’s the case, what should brands do to stay relevant to their consumers? They must offer novel, unfamiliar and exciting consumer experiences to improve their businesses. They must recourse, change, and transform. Now.</p>
<p>R/GA presented the model of transformation they use to help their clients address the transformation that their company needs: Business Transformation, Experience Transformation, and Marketing Transformation.</p>
<p>Business Transformation, is the C-level of transformation for a company and usually dives into having a new business model, new product or service, or identifying an adjacent market to enter. <strong>“If you’re a mature company, let’s say you’ve been an industry leader for years, you’re probably feeling some disruption, and that’s probably business transformation led.”</strong> Experience Transformation relates to companies looking to up their game and increase their consumers. <strong>“When a company is in an earlier stage and it needs to upgrade its experience or it needs to broaden its consumer base, that would probably be led by an experience transformation type effort.”</strong></p>
<p>R/GA’s VP for Products &amp; Services Ben Williams discussed how they cultivated experience transformation among consumers of the Jordan brand by creating the world’s first commerce experience in augmented reality. R/GA, together with Snapchat, Shopify, and Darkstore allowed consumers to reimagine and celebrate the 30 years since Michael Jordan’s iconic free throw line dunk through the Snapchat E-commerce campaign that was launched during the NBA All-Star Game weekend.</p>
<p>The campaign gave consumers a new shopping experience by allowing Snapchat users attending the NBA All-Star Game event to access a special 3D Augmented Reality World Lens of Michael Jordan’s iconic free throw line in the slam dunk contest from 1988. Through this custom World Lens, users could also see the new Air Jordan III Tinkers which could be purchased in the Snap Store powered by Shopify and have their sneakers delivered to them in less than two hours through Darkstore express delivery.</p>
<p>And finally, the talk focused on Marketing Transformation, which refers to adding value through creativity and looks into opportunities for agencies to be creative all the way along a customer’s journey. For instance, R/GA’s campaign for Jet.com — which highlights the innovativeness of the brand and its dedication to save its consumers money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Mikey Fleming</strong>, Art Director</em></p>
<p>In the basement of the Palais, the Cannes Lions Festival hub, every piece of shortlisted work is on display. The sheer amount of work was overwhelming, but I did my best to check out as much as I could, with a particular focus on Print and Outdoor. I’m going to take you through just a few of the standouts. It was the fast food brands who were showing big brands just how print is done. Burger King, as always, had a strong showing with their now clearly cemented irreverent tone, constantly poking fun at their rival McDonalds. Two campaigns from different regions, <strong>‘Come as a Clown, Eat Like a King’</strong> and <strong>‘McMansions’</strong>, both pushed the boundaries of what a brand can legally do or say in print.</p>
<p>KFC had two fantastic, highly commended campaigns. One for their Hot &amp; Spicy Chicken, which, in a series of images, simply swapped out explosions with a macro shot of their deep-fried chicken. But the real standout was the now infamous <strong>‘FCK’</strong> press ad. This is how you do an apology ad. Timed perfectly, with exactly the right tone, this ad only ran once but was shared 2 million times on social media and became an international story. But most importantly, the reaction from the public was overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>McDonalds had a number of pieces on display throughout the basement, all showing demonstrations of great minimalist print. None more so than the Outdoor Grand Prix winning work <strong>‘Follow the Arches’</strong>. An incredibly brave and confident outdoor campaign that cropped different parts of the McDonald’s arches to work as directions to their nearest restaurant. In a brave move, only the cropped versions of the arches and the brand colours were the only branding visible within the ad, yet there was never any question as to who it was for.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the amount of work on display was jaw-dropping, as was the quality. There were too many to go into in detail, but the following three innovative pieces of print that found new ways to use the medium are too good not to mention. The IKEA pregnancy test, an ad you peed on to determine if you were pregnant, and if you were, turned into a voucher to use on a discounted crib, ALDI <strong>‘Fresh Prints’</strong>, a real-time print ad and finally the Grand Prix winning Budweiser Tag Words, which found a clever way of using expensive photography without paying the usage. Each one a brilliant demonstration of how best to innovatively use the medium, proving that print isn’t dead, it’s constantly being reinvented by game-changing brands.</p>

<p>Sitting in the sun having the chats over a few cans is an age-old Irish tradition. This year, Shane, Mikey and I decided to share this tradition with the South of France, with our interview series, Bag of Cannes. The crystal-clear waters of Cannes were no scaldy canal, but we made do. Over the four days, we interviewed four very different people at the festival, and got four very different perspectives on the famously extravagant creative festival.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/276213568?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<h3><span style="color: #f03694;">Rory Hamilton</span> ECD of Boys+Girls (A.K.A. Our Boss)</h3>
<p>To kicks things off, and to lay down a few ground rules for the week, we spoke to the boss, Rory Hamilton. As always, our fearless leader taught us a lot. We learnt that Rosé O’Clock is 11am, you should always go big on the first night and that lunch can cost you €495 if you get stuck with the bill. And most importantly, we learnt that our job in Cannes was to see amazing work and meet the people who made it — so that we can try to produce it ourselves.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/276416266?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<h3><span style="color: #f03694;">Resh Sidhu</span> Creative Director at AKQA New York</h3>
<p>Next up, we got to speak to Resh Sidhu from New York agency, AKQA. She was on the jury for Digital Craft and gave us some great advice on how to win a Cannes Lion. Resh told us that original work that connects with people, moves out of the mediocre and into the incredible will win at Cannes. Sounds like a lot of effort. Luckily for us, she revealed her winning secret — at concept stage, write the press release. This forces you to think about how you’ll communicate it to the world, and will help you decide if you truly think the idea is original and great. Easy.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/276452362?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<h3><span style="color: #f03694;">Matt Lawford</span> Cannes Veteran</h3>
<p>Matt Lawford is in insurance for TV, film and advertising. He’s been to 15 Cannes Lion festivals. This was his 10th in a row. He’s more used to €60 Gin &amp; Tonics up in the Carlton Terrace, but he kindly agreed to slum it with us on the beach. He shared a warm can with us, and a few great stories. As we know absolutely nothing about insurance, we learnt a bit about that. Apparently, it would cost 200 grand to insure Bag of Cannes, and that the insurance game is a lot sexier and exciting than we thought. He’s worked with Cara Delevingne, Zac Efron and a vicious monkey. And interestingly, he much prefers Cannes Lions over the film festival, as it’s shorter and more manageable. Didn’t want to go to the other one anyway.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/276836965?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<h3><span style="color: #f03694;">Michael+Patrick</span> The Shirtlist Guys</h3>
<p>We met Michael and Patrick on our first night at the LadBible pool party. They’re a young creative team from agency Zulu Alpha Kilo in Canada. Even amongst the models, the floating DJ and the sax player, these guys stood out. They both wore matching yellow t-shirts with a list of things they needed to achieve at Cannes — ‘The Shirtlist’. This included comparing shoes with Shaq, blagging their way onto a yacht, expensing dinner at a Michelin star restaurant, sharing a bucket of chicken with The Colonel, shooting a music video in a fast car, and lots more overly extravagant things only available and acceptable in Cannes. They achieved them all, bar the Shaq one, they were pretty cut up about missing that.</p>
<p>This project taught me two things. Firstly, the power of a great pun. But maybe more surprisingly, how far something physical can still get you. This year, Cannes was full of technological advances, such as giving people with ALS their voice back through old recordings, or a complete VR music video. Yet, these two boys connected with everybody at Cannes through the medium of a simple t-shirt. Well 5 simple t-shirts, they changed it every day, apparently.</p>
<p>To sum up, we learnt that drunk people who agree to interviews don’t mail you back. We learnt that we can’t afford to pick up the cheque in most places, and we learnt that all we have to do to win is to create great work. Oh, and we learnt that we definitely should have worn Bag of Cannes t-shirts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Bairbre McGlade</strong>, Senior Art Director</em></p>
<p>This year the Cannes Lions Creative Marketer of the Year went to Google Chief Marketing Officer, (and Irish woman), <strong>Lorraine Twohill</strong>. The award recognises a brand that, over the years, has demonstrated that they believe and invest in creativity.</p>
<p>The MD of the Cannes Lions, Jose Papa, introduced her on stage by saying: <br />
 <strong>“The Creative Marketer of The Year Award honours a brand that consistently delivers outstanding creative storytelling, challenges the status quo, and sets a global bench mark of excellence.”</strong></p>
<p>He went on to describe Google as an organisation that has changed our lives and the way our world runs:<br />
 <strong>“Alongside it’s obvious achievements as a tech company, Google has crafted a reputation as a brand that delivers marketing campaigns that are bold, courageous and creative at heart.”</strong></p>
<p>Google has won 127 Lions since 2007, eight of which have been Grands Prix. In 2012, it reinvented Coca-Cola’s classic <strong>‘Hilltop’</strong> ad for a modern audience, enabling mobile users to send a stranger a free Coke anywhere in the world through connected vending machines.</p>
<p>Their Grand Prix-winning work with DeepMind Alphago was not just a brilliant marketing opportunity for their tech capabilities, but also represented a genuine turning point for AI.</p>
<p>The same can be said of Google’s VR 3D painting app Tilt Brush, which has won two gold Lions. In 2015, the company also earned a Grand Prix for Google Cardboard, an invention that is, in many ways, the opposite of more tech heavy examples previously cited, and yet just as bar-raising. This VR viewer is made of basic materials but was the first step towards democratising the VR experience and gaining brands a mass audience in that space.</p>
<p>So, what can we learn from Google? Their work consistently shows real people in real life, using Google tools to do something amazing. Their marketing efforts are all purely product-led. They are consistent in that everything they create is helpful. They aim to solve problems for the user, take pain away, and bring in Google cleverness to make the experience better.</p>
<p>Having a positive impact on culture was something that came up in every<strong> ‘Inside the Jury Room’</strong> session in Cannes this year, and is something that can be taken on board by any brand — not just those who are the size of Google.</p>
<p>Hailing from Carlow, Lorraine Twohill is only the second woman in 25 years to accept the Creative Marketer of the Year award in Cannes. She closed her winning speech, by saying that Google is <strong>“not an easy client”</strong> and that the company doesn’t give its agencies <strong>“easy briefs”</strong>.</p>
<p>She finished off by saying that being one of two women to accept the award is <strong>‘lonely’</strong> and that she’d like more women to be recognised with <br />
 the award.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <strong>Aoife Murphy</strong>, Senior Digital Strategist</em></p>
<p>Winning a Cannes Lion isn’t supposed to be easy. The title quote from Harjot Singh at the Future of Creative Effectiveness debate on the Thursday at Cannes captures the effort required perfectly. If your work doesn’t make people feel, think, believe or do something — is it a metal-winning idea? Probably not.</p>
<p>Calculating a <strong>‘winning formula’</strong> for the Lions is a bit of a moving target. Trends and jurors change year to year as do the motivations of the winning work. However, compelling people to act has always been the primary goal of advertising and there were clear themes throughout the winning work this year.</p>
<p>Cannes Lions are about being first. The first to execute an idea, apply an insight, use a technology, create a new product, identify an issue. The judges have Google, if it’s been done before the work comes off the shortlist table. A clever application of this first mentality was use of facial recognition to help voters identify corrupt politicians via their smartphone in <strong>‘The Colour of Corruption’</strong> for consumer watchdog, Reclame Aqui.</p>
<p>Commercial success is rising higher up the judging agenda but impact on culture was a heavy presence in this year’s work. Proof of impact via behaviour change or public discussion was a big signifier of good work at this year’s awards. Pedigree’s<strong> ‘Child Replacement Programme’ </strong>is a great example of this, the <br />
 idea calling for empty nesters to adopt a dog drove an 8% increase in sales alongside global PR for a domestic campaign.</p>
<p>Moving people requires a connection. Emotion is a much-employed tactic in advertising and while the usual tear-jerkers apply, work that catches you off guard is equally as memorable. In fact, according to a 2017 review of four years of Lion-winning case studies, advertising reported as annoying or weird made up 34% <br />
 of the top work. A great example of <strong>‘weird’</strong> gold winning work in print and outdoor from KFC.</p>
<p>Many charity metal-winning pieces get a lot of flak for not being brand or business related. Indeed, social change and cause marketing was omnipresent at this year’s Cannes but jurors appeared to be more interested in what brands were doing to contribute to the solution rather than just raising awareness. The wonderful ‘Trash Isles’ by Plastic Oceans and LadBible took a well-known issue, the plastic pollution in our seas, and drove towards a solution by creating a campaign with so much momentum that it was raised at the UN.</p>
<p>And then of course there are the outliers that could never be predicted or created by an algorithm. Work that is so beautifully crafted and unique in its execution that it deserves to be recognised as a beacon in the industry.</p>
<p>This year was not short of examples. Apple was one of the standout clients with a number of gongs in the craft categories led by their ‘Welcome Home’ spot featuring FKA Twigs.</p>
