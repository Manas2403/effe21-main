<h4><strong>The #1 Strategy of High-Performance Brands</strong></h4>
<p><em>For this month&#8217;s Book Club, Charlotte Bourke gives us her take on &#8220;Zag: The #1 Strategy of High-Performance Brands&#8221; by Marty Neumeier.<br /></em></p>
<p>Marty Neumeier has written several excellent books on brands and branding. His most influential being The Brand Gap and ZAG.</p>
<p>ZAG maintains The Brand Gap’s ultra-clear narrative style but delves deeper into the question of how brands can harness the power of differentiation to stand out. The purpose of this book is to help brands in developing a value proposition that is distinct from competitors&#8217; offerings. Neumeier contends that in today&#8217;s extremely crowded marketplace, traditional differentiation is no longer sufficient; instead, companies must engage in &#8220;<em>radical differentiation</em>&#8221; to create long-term value for their shareholders and customers. The new rule? When everyone else zigs, you must ZAG.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>What did I think</h4>
<p>If you search for the term &#8220;branding&#8221; on Google, you will find 6,999,000,000 results in less than a second. It’s something everyone knows and talks about, but only a small handful have built a successful brand and can explain how they did it. Neumeier has and can. He delivers just the right amount of information and clear direction by using clever examples that help define the process of successful branding. The book does well in breaking down this process into easy-to-follow steps, helpfully devoid of any business jargon, instead focusing on being logical and effective.</p>
<p>The core concept within these some 200 pages really focuses on the importance of finding, building, and maintaining one’s ZAG; the differentiating factor, which when viewed by consumers, works to define a brand. In effect, it requires looking at what your competition is doing, then doing something different in response – <em>really</em> different. But so many brands today simply follow the market, which results in them getting lost amongst the clutter of an extremely crowded marketplace. In fact, oftentimes, the enemy isn’t a competing company but is in fact the old way of doing things (zigging along with your competitors).</p>
<p>If you think about it, the average person is estimated to be exposed to anything from 6,000 to 10,000 ads every single day – that’s a lot to be thrown anyone’s way, so you might forgive someone for not being able to remember every single piece of comms they ‘see’ (<em>especially when so many are all trying to do the same thing</em>). People may be getting exposed to thousands of ads every day, but they aren’t really <em>seeing</em> very many of them. In short, without any sort of radical differentiation, even the most successful of brands can run the risk of getting lost in the abyss of beige-ness.</p>
<p>By breaking down <em>ZAG</em> into 3 core factors, Neumeier gives his readers an easy-to-understand guide to effectively standing out against the competition:</p>
<p><strong>1. Finding your Zag:<br /></strong>This part is self-explanatory; to find your zag, you first need to go where your competition isn’t (differentiation); find the dynamics between different and good; look for the white space and find ways to parade it (finding a trend) – these core areas serve as the keys to finding your zag.</p>
<p><strong>2. Designing (and building) your Zag:<br /></strong>In this section, Neumeier shares his “17 checkpoints” system designed to invoke both reflective &amp; pragmatic thought by asking key questions at each stage; starting out with “<em>who are you</em>” and “<em>what do you do</em>” and finishing with “<em>how do you extend your success</em>” and “<em>how do you protect your portfolio</em>”. </p>
<p><strong>3. Renewing your Zag: <br /></strong>While the bulk of this book focuses on helping readers in finding and designing their zag, the final (albeit smaller) section provides a plethora of valuable resources for those who may need a zag renewal – those more established brands/businesses who may have potentially lost some of their focus along the way. Key insights are provided to help businesses to find both their uniqueness and their vision once again.</p>
<p>Overall, this book is well written, concise and to the point; filled with nuggets of wisdom that are as effective as they are logical. While it isn’t necessarily a heavily padded read (I flew through it in a few short sessions), it’s an ideal size to keep, a book you can refer to time and time again for snippets of advice and inspiration on how to do different.</p>
<p>To quote Neumeier, “<em>brand history abounds with evidence that David can take on Goliath and win – the goal is not to topple the big guys, but to employ the principle of contrast to throw your zag into sharp relief</em>”.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Who should read it</h4>
<p>I would encourage anyone who may be interested in starting their own business, who is in any sort of business leadership position (both within and outside of marketing and communications departments) or whose curiosity is piqued by doing and thinking differently to pick themselves up a copy of this today.</p>
<h2>★★★★★ (out of 5)</h2>

<p><em>by Margaret Gilsenan, <span>Chief Strategy Officer</span><br /></em></p>
<p>For anyone who has entered industry awards, you will know they are hard work.  The AIMs, D&amp;ADs, ICADs, Sharks, Effies, Cannes, all involve various levels of selecting work, poring over data, writing papers, creating case films.  And when you have an entry date looming, you ask yourself the question… is this worth it?  Would life not be easier without constant competition?</p>
<p>There is also a creeping prevailing sense in society that competition is bad, it brings out the worst in us.  It creates inequality.  It should be confined to the sports field.</p>
<p>Having asked my competitive self ‘is this worth it’ mid Effies, I decided to study what advantage competition brings with it, for us as individuals and as businesses.  My conclusion is that I agree with  Tim Cook who said &#8220;<em>The reality is, is that we love competition….. we think it makes us all better”</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly the writings also suggest that there is as much advantage to competing with yourself as there is with others. Setting your own goals, beating your own previously held records.</p>
<p>Here are ten benefits (there are probably more) outlining the common themes across all my reading that healthy competition* brings with it… in life, in sport, in business.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It keeps us on our toes</strong>. Having a competitive nature prevents complacency.  If you succeed, you are motivated to always improve.  If you fail, you can use it to motivate yourself to keep going. </li>
<li><strong>It generates more clarity</strong>. You can’t be competitive at something unless you know what you are aiming for.</li>
<li><strong>It inspires greater creativity</strong>. To do things better, you need to be a better problem solver and be more solution driven.</li>
<li><strong>It causes you to do more self-reflection</strong>. To do better, you will need to know your strengths and weaknesses, and identify what you need to improve.</li>
<li><strong>It compels us to give things a go</strong>. Because competitive people tend to see failure as part of the journey not the end of it. They are more comfortable failing, in the hope that next time will be better/successful.</li>
<li><strong>It is satisfying</strong>. When managed properly, and realistically, it brings the satisfaction of completing goals.</li>
<li><strong>It motivates us to strive to do better.</strong> <em>&#8220;Believing that your competition is stronger and better than you pushes you to better yourselves.&#8221;</em> Simon Sinek.</li>
<li><strong>It makes us resilient.</strong> Competitive people don’t always win, they have to have wider comfort zones.  You learn to cope with failing, to dust yourself down, and get back on that horse.</li>
<li><strong>It makes us makes us hopeful.</strong> You look to the competition, and ask if they can do it so can I?  You focus on the good, and ignore the bad. </li>
<li><strong>It helps us to live fuller lives</strong>, because you live with the belief that anything is possible. Michael Jordan: <em>&#8220;You have competition every day because you set such high standards for yourself that you have to go out every day and live up to that.&#8221;</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Off now to compete against myself,  Je pars pour établir un nouveau record personnel en Duolingo.</p>
<p><em>* Disclaimer: Love this picture of the Bonny Baby competition in Butlins but do not consider it ‘Healthy Competition’.</em></p>

<h4>40 Ways To Stack The Odds In Your Brand&#8217;s Favour</h4>
<p><em>Patrick Meade, Chief Executive Officer at Boys+Girls, is here this month with his take on “Go Luck Yourself&#8221; by Andy Nairn<br /></em></p>
<p>Luck is a four-letter-word in business circles. But the truth is that fortune plays a part in every success story – and every failure. In this book, Andy Nairn discusses 40 ways to stack the odds in your brand’s favour.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>What did I think</h4>
<p>Undeterred by the puntastic title, I was really looking forward to this book. Andy is a founder and chief strategist for Lucky Generals &#8211; one of the most successful UK start-ups in recent years, with a long list of award-winning creative effectiveness campaigns for local and international brands like Hovis and Amazon Prime.<br /><br />In reality, this is less of a book and more a collection of case studies akin to the familiar style of Dave Trott’s collection of columns for Campaign that he has formed into successful books in recent years. The way the book is constructed makes this effort more useful in my opinion. While there is always a great lesson in each of Dave’s yarns, Andy gives the reader more digestible strategic advice in each chapter. There are good local and international examples to back up each piece of advice, and he extends these beyond case studies from his own career and agency. Which is good because otherwise it might read more like a CV.<br /><br />The title itself is tongue in cheek. None of the examples are what you could truly describe as luck, like finding a twenty euro note on the pavement. They are really examples of broad thinking that may appear as luck to the untrained eye, but in truth are very deliberate acts. I agree with Andy that luck, and indeed its sibling ‘gut instinct’, are mistreated in commercial circles. Both are misnomers. Often used inaccurately to describe what is usually the result of a relentlessly curious mind.<br /><br />This book won’t make you luckier. You won’t bounce from one Effectiveness Gold to the next just by reading it. However, it will make you a better strategic thinker. Which is unsurprising as it comes from one of the brightest planning minds of his generation.<br /><br />Because Andy is well known in agency land, I think this book is more likely to be read by agency people, but I think everyone in a marketing role could read and learn from it. Many of the lessons in it apply to ‘conventional thinking’ in client organisations that end up being challenged by more free thinking (and risk tasking) agency strategists. If that conventional thinking can be challenged before the agency is briefed, it would multiply the success rate and make the challenge of selling unconventional ideas easier to stakeholders.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Who should read it</h4>
<p>In summary, I’d advise you to read the book, be entertained by the stories, then copy and paste each of the 40 questions that end every chapter into a document. The next time you’re facing a tricky brand situation or a challenging brief, try posing these questions to the problem, one-by-one, until it sparks something. You never know. You might get lucky and find the answer staring you in the face.</p>
<h2>★★★★ (out of 5)</h2>
<p>I’m docking it one star because it’s a bit short and just about walks on the right side of the line between helpful advice and a Lucky Generals credentials presentation.</p>

<p><em>by Karleen Smyth, <span>Senior Experiential Director</span><br /></em></p>
<p>Our world was upended in 2020. Amid the global chaos, brands who had spent many months and euros curating their experiential marketing plans had to pull the plug, at the time not knowing if it was the right thing to do. Anything that involved physical customer engagement was deemed unsafe. It’s the type of situation that will form the basis of case studies in years to come.</p>
<p>18+ months later, and despite mass vaccine roll-out, we are still living surrounded by a level of uncertainty. Many industry professionals were certain September 2021 would mark the point where some form of normality would resume. Yet, we are still waiting for that assurance.</p>
<p>From an industry perspective, it’s easy to focus on the negatives, the missed opportunities, missed experiences. When we speak about experiential marketing, the conversation focuses on the lack of live events. Yes, it’s true, we’ve missed out on some great live experiences, the big and the small. Who would have thought that the legendary Glastonbury Festival wouldn’t celebrate their 50th birthday. However we need to recognise that there have been some positives to come from all of this. Experiential marketing is a big part of how brands stay relevant and connected with, and as an industry we have been forced to think differently and more creatively about how to use experiential marketing in the face of a Pandemic and Post Pandemic world.</p>
<p>With physical experiences no longer an option, the industry searched for alternatives and undertook an impressive digital transformation. Tomorrowland Festival is a great example of this. The team behind the Belgian music festival pushed the boundaries of the latest technology available and created a revolutionary interactive virtual world. And whilst this was the ultimate online music experience with truly impressive production values, the conclusion was that there is nothing quite like the engagement of an in-person experience.</p>
<p>So, how do we adapt to a world where live is not always going to be possible for everyone? How do we take the positives of our lockdown experiences and invent an experiential world that is even better for our brands? One that ensures maximum leverage of what social epidemiologists are predicting as a post-pandemic ‘roaring 20’s’, where people are expected to seek out all-embracing social interactions, just as they did after the 1918 flu pandemic?</p>
<p>How do we get match-fit for a new experiential world with new behaviours, new rules and new technologies?</p>
<p>We have seen AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality) and even XR (Extended Reality), form the basis for many concepts. But future-facing brands are already moving onto the next era. We are now exploring a shift in the way consumers and brands interact, and looking at how we as an industry create and utilise a strong hybrid brand identity, the metaverse. Yes, it’s a term used in a 1992 sci-fi film, but it’s<strong> </strong>also set to be a new chapter of the experience economy. A network of always-on virtual environments in which multiple people, operating avatars of themselves, can interact with digital objects and engage with one another. Netflix were quick to move into this space and have just launched a gamified version of the iconic <em>Stranger Things</em> Starcourt Mall on metaverse platform Roblox, whilst other brands are experimenting with the platform by leveraging existing virtual platforms. It’s the next level for brands to create a two-way interactive and dynamic relationship with their consumers.</p>
<p>Though this may be a step too far, too soon for many, it is important to keep a watchful eye on this space. Because, 2020/21 has shown that it’s time to embrace a different type of experiential thinking and to put it at the heart of brand building. Brands need to keep an open-mind and explore new routes to engage with their audience. Progression is vital. No matter what the format, it is possible to ensure your brand produces an effective and engaging experience, provided you’re working with good data, clear objectives and a strong baseline strategy.</p>
<p>This new world involves engaging people differently and making sure your audience knows you’re listening. We now know the possibilities are endless, we just have to embrace them!</p>

<h3><strong>How Anthropology Can Explain Business &amp; Life. <br /></strong></h3>
<p><em>This month Marget Gilsenan, Chief Strategy Officer gives us her opinions on “How Anthropology Can Explain Business &amp; Life&#8221; by Gillian Tett.</em></p>
<p>In Anthro-Vision Gillian Tett reveals how anthropology can make sense of the corporate world.  That it is not just a tool to study tribes and cultures in far flung places, but rather a powerful way to understand human behaviour, identify webs of meaning and complement and enhance how we understand the world and the larger cultural context of our business decisions.</p>
<p>Using diverse examples from pre-school selection, Cambridge Analytica, the 2008 crash, Trump, working from home, petfood, soup, laundry habits, sustainability – Tett shows how anthropology can be used to help us observe the tribes and rituals and exist all around us “hidden in plain sight” and help us make better decisions in our business and personal lives.</p>
<h4>What did I think</h4>
<p>This book champions two fundamental truths that I subscribe to in business. One, that as quoted from Meg Kinney, <em>“Every business problem is a human problem, and every data point represents some human behaviour at its core”</em>; and two, to provide truly creative solutions to those problems, each of us will be better and more open to new thinking if we are compulsively curious.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections, each peppered with examples and insights from Tett’s own experiences, huge social issues and the corporate world.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Making the “Strange” Familiar</strong>. It challenges us to stop shying away from that which seems strange, but rather work with it.  To recognise that your worldview is not everyone’s. There is a nice example to do with in-car technology.  Car drivers had been asked direct questions about technology which they claimed to be using.  Engineers installed embedded voice command systems in cars to reduce distracted driving.  They were starting with their own world view of it. But subsequently when observed, drivers were using the technology but not through the in-built in-car tech, they were actually using their personal handheld devices.  So, the solution which we see in most cars nowadays is the ability to sync our own personal devices with our cars i.e. looking at the world through the user&#8217;s eyes.</li>
<li><strong>Making the ‘Familiar” Strange</strong>. As Anais Nin said <em>“what we are familiar with, we fail to see”</em>.  With Tett’s experience as The Financial Time’s, Editor At Large – there are numerous examples from the financial world and how that familiarity or normalising of certain behaviours, acronyms etc within the financial ‘tribe’ played a significant role in the 2008 crash.  She challenges us to think and study our own WEIRD world (Western, Educated, Individualistic, Rich and Democratic) to help understand (and stop missing) behaviours and triggers that shape our decisions, with examples including how after an anthropological study of food preparation, Campbell’s Soup successfully moved their marketing emphasis from convenience (the reported benefit) to creativity (the observed benefit) of their brand in its users lives.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Listen to Social Silence</strong> and see what is hidden in plain sight. To see beyond the words that are being spoken and create frames of analysis that help us make sense of all that is going on&#8230; examples here from Trump (and why his use of the word ‘Bigly’ should not have been dismissed) and Cambridge Analytica.<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<p>It also helps us use Big Data more effectively, <em>“We have been forced to rethink some of the ways we use data, at the beginning there was a lot of excitement about Big Data and we still firmly believe that getting better statistics is very important and technology can do amazing things.  But we cannot be naïve – understanding the social context matters”</em>, Melinda Gates.</p>
<p>This book provokes each of us to ask the right questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Who should read it</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is not a marketing book; it is for anyone who recognises the importance and value of being compulsively curious. Across all disciplines.</li>
<li>Anyone who is working with Big Data as a deeper cultural understanding or open-mindedness will complement and give context to that Data making it more valuable.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>by Rory Hamilton, Chief Creative Officer<br /></em></p>
<p>I have been lucky enough to judge a number of advertising awards. If you’ve never done it, it’s an interesting process. You fly to somewhere sunny (think Dubai or Las Vegas)  and then spend a week frustratingly locked in a dark room with no windows alongside a dozen strangers, for 12 hours a day, to argue over some of the best work in the world. It&#8217;s tiring, occasionally confrontational (the jurors are opinionated people whose profession revolves around building convincing arguments) but it’s also genuinely life changing. Something about this pressurised environment coupled with the enforced exposure makes you friends with these people – you can build relationships that’ll last your whole career. All in all it’s a privilege, you can learn more in a week’s judging than you might in a year of work.  </p>
<p>Judging Cannes is arguably the high point of this judging circuit, so 2 years ago when I was invited to judge at Cannes Lions, boy was I excited. The prospect of a week surrounded by some of the most inspirational creatives in the world, all in the South of France was an enticing one. It would be fair to say that, during those 2 years, more important global events transpired (no need to fire up those tiny violins for me) so when the Cannes festival was postponed and eventually cancelled in 2020, it was inevitably replaced by a remote festival in 2021. I was still invited to judge, only this time from the “comfort” of my house.</p>
<p>Remote judging is a different animal entirely. For Cannes it involved a pre-judging section, for which you had approximately 40-50 hours of films to watch over a few weeks, followed by an “in person” Zoom judging, which took 5 hrs a day for 8 days. The jurors were selected from all over the world, making time zones a massive issue. We Europeans got lucky, so that my sessions were 2-7pm. Spare a thought for the jurors from LA or Buenos Aires whose sessions started as early as 5am, and for our friend from Tokyo, his day started at 10pm.</p>
<p>The thing about judging remotely is that it brings all of the argument, but little of the conciliatory coffee breaks or boozy dinners together in which you get to heal the wounds of battle. You never really get a handle on your fellow jurors, you never see where they’re coming from, save a small section of their bedroom wall or blurred office &#8211; their whole backstory told across a few feet of backdrop. And instead of real discourse, instead of real debate you sit muzzled, on-mute until it’s your turn to make a case for, or against a piece of work. I sat on my hands so long they developed “pins and needles”.</p>
<p>Worse still when you’re judging remotely you&#8217;re “available”. Somehow being in Cannes seems out of bounds, but when you’re “upstairs” – surely you can mind the baby, let the electrician in, settle your children’s sisterly dispute – after all you’re right there. Same goes for the office, little meetings get “popped in diaries”, “just a catch up, to keep you in the loop”. Try squeezing an extra 5 hour zoom call into your day – it’s not easy.</p>
<p>However by the end of the 8 days the work became second nature, no need to view an entry for the 400<sup>th</sup> time, I could recite the scripts as I judged them. Through that fog, with the pressure of an impending deadline, we found our rhythm. Somehow this band of strangers had become a group, even a team. We settled disputes, we supported opinions, we leaned on each other’s individual expertise (shouldn’t the professional grader have the casting vote when we are judging grade?) It only took 40 hours of zooming together but we became friends. Spending that amount of time, not just among the best work in the world, but surrounded by some of the best people was just as inspiring, just as much of an honour as it would have been from the South of France.</p>
<p>But at the end of it all, would I consider judging Cannes again from my house? Not remotely.</p>
<p>Postscript.</p>
<p>Not only did I judge Cannes for the first time, but we also won it. Yes you may have heard, I’ve been trying to casually shoehorn it into conversation for the last few weeks, a Gold and a Bronze. It&#8217;s incredible in its own right. But I do think that experiencing the process of judging makes the result even more gratifying. So to whatever jurors sat and argued for our work, from whatever bedroom or office around the world – thank you! I know it wasn’t easy.</p>

<h3><strong>The Ministry of Common Sense: How to eliminate bureaucratic red tape, bad excuses and corporate bullshit. By Martin Lindstrom<br></strong></h3>
<p><em>For this month&#8217;s B+G Book Club, Mark O&#8217;Connor, Business Director, cuts through the red tape with Lindstrom&#8217;s new book.<br></em></p>
<p><span>A different kind of book than his previous works on branding and data vs intelligence, this book is built on the back of Lindstrom’s evolution from Brand Guru to Consultant on business and culture transformation to large companies. He takes this opportunity to walk us through his view on what is going on within company structures and processes that inhibits the customer experience and overall company success. He isolates 6 major factors responsible for a decline in empathy, and with it, common sense.</span></p>
<h4><strong>What did I think</strong></h4>
<p><span>This book doesn’t necessarily point out anything new to us – and that’s not a bad thing. It is well written, very accessible and full of entertaining tales of common sense gone missing. But it does also give us a guide to think through how we could bring common sense back to our work places, and gives us the tools to analyse our processes and ways of working to understand whether they are actually helping or hindering us.</span></p>
<p><span>By breaking down his 6 key factors in the suspension of common sense, we are given a path to reflect on how we experience / see this in both our working lives, and as consumers. For me, the key learning from this book is looking at it less at the ‘corporate’ level, but at how these factors impact our specific teams / projects, helping it feel more tangible and impactful than wholescale corporate-culture overhauls.</span></p>
<p><strong>1. Broken Corporate Ecosystem</strong></p>
<p><span>Unclear accountability, lack of decision-making, lack of ownership. This all manifests in customer experience, be it through direct comms with customer care or fractured sales processes. Within a project team, clear roles of approvals and decision-making are essential from the outset, which further enhances meeting efficiencies.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. Internal Politics</strong></p>
<p><span>They are everywhere, in every organisation, and can seriously limit the effectiveness of teams. How, as a project team, can we navigate wider politics, and try to minimise its impact within the project?</span></p>
<p><strong>3. Technology</strong></p>
<p><span>Lindstrom doesn’t really like technology, and sees companies rely too heavily on data, versus genuine customer knowledge. It serves as a constant reminder to sense-check the role of the data we use, what it is actually telling us, and whether it is evidence of real customer behaviour.</span></p>
<p><strong>4. Meetings &amp; Presentations</strong></p>
<p><span>Again, Lindstrom isn’t a fan of meetings, and definitely not presentations. He asserts that 90% of meetings do not serve any purpose. As an agency, we try and be really clear on the objective of every meeting, and to ensure people understand their role in it. Still, our days end up filled with meetings, so always room for improvement.</span></p>
<p><strong>5. Regulations &amp; Policies</strong></p>
<p><span>Following the rules, because they are the rules, is a certain road to losing our hold on common sense. Lindstrom uses some crazy examples to land this point, and one that is close to my heart jumped out. Due to the limitations of a clients IT system, they could not receive a document of 49MB through email – instead, the document had to be divided up and shared in equal chunks through 49 separate emails. Apply this same logic to not being able to access file-sharing platforms. I’ve personally encountered this hurdle more than three times this year….</span></p>
<p><strong>6. Compliance / Legal</strong></p>
<p><span>Lindstrom sees Compliance &amp; Legal as a company’s way of not doing things, of limiting any change. Hours can be spent on both client and agency sides in navigating a Compliance conversation, often resulting in less impactful work, or in limiting the ability of comms to seize a time-sensitive moment or opportunity. Again, we know that Compliance / Legal is a requirement of much of our work, but how do we best reduce the potential challenges they may have, and build it in to the project / work earlier to avoid limiting effectiveness in the closing stages?</span></p>
<p><span>Overall, Lindstrom is lamenting the fact that corporate structures and processes have distracted people from doing their real jobs – they are focussed on navigating red tape, or office politics, or getting a campaign through compliance – instead of being focussed on offering their consumers a better product, experience and being more attuned to their needs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Who should read it</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Anyone<span> who works. While Lindstrom has focussed on the corporate levels that led to such errors as a TV remote with two ‘On’ buttons, the factors and thinking can be applied to teams and project levels to make our working time more effective, and closer to what our jobs are supposed to be about.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Star Rating (Out of 5)</span></h4>

<p><em data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">by Bridget Johnson, Executive Creative Director<br></em></p>
<p><span>Adland’s ‘Oscars’&nbsp;– The Cannes Lions – are just around the corner, with all its pomp and perhaps a little less pageantry this year and still Cannes and other celebrated awards shows often trigger an old debate:&nbsp;Are awards necessary? Do we need them or are they just another money spinner, an excuse for agencies and clients to pat themselves on the back and throw a hellava party?<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, of course, they’re an excuse to throw a party and, God knows, we could all use one or two more of those right now but, truthfully, there are damn fine reasons to enter, acknowledge and celebrate great work through awards shows.<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn’t always feel this way. A bit like Anne Hathaway in ‘A Devil Wears Prada’ I walked into advertising much the same way as she walked into the fashion world:&nbsp;naive and a little smug, believing that I understood exactly how the industry worked.&nbsp;I had clear views on what was right and wrong. Creative people setting benchmarks for what was good and bad was wrong. The notion of creatives celebrating themselves was just arrogant.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, it’s not as simple as that.&nbsp;A while later I found myself (happily) in an agency of incredibly talented people.&nbsp;They weren’t arrogant.&nbsp;The best of them did not trumpet their ‘genius’ from the rooftops, but simply got on with it as if possessed by some unseen force that drove them to produce work that everyone could <em>feel </em>was great. Instantly. Their work went on to consistently excite the client for which it was produced and the agency was one of the most awarded in South Africa (my home country) at the time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The award-winning work did something else too.&nbsp;It drew new talent to the agency and became part of the agency’s culture of excellence. I know what you’re thinking: what about the client here?&nbsp; What did it do for them? What did it do for the business and is there any commercial benefit to awards for clients once the champagne fizz fizzles.<br>&nbsp;<br>There most certainly are benefits for clients.<br>&nbsp;<br>The client I’m referring to in the example above as KFC and the agency was Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Johannesburg. Over an 8-year period, KFC’s steady growth can be tracked alongside regular, significant awards in most market segments. While I’m not suggesting that awarded advertising work alone was responsible for the brand’s success, I don’t believe it was coincidental either.<br>&nbsp;<br>Perhaps a more recent, global example is that of Burger King and its stratospheric growth under the leadership of CMO, Fernando Marchado, a loud, proud advocate for using creativity aggressively as a competitive edge. His current Cannes Lions awards tally (not to mention other award shows) sits at 160 and we haven’t seen this year’s results yet. Marchado believes that “future marketing leaders will need to not just invest, but <em>believe</em> that creativity can be a source of competitive advantage.”&nbsp;And that’s the crux of it:<br>&nbsp;<br><em>Awards facilitate the belief and motivation that spurs creative people on to achieve beyond anyone’s wildest expectations. And when we do, it can be transformative for business.</em><br>&nbsp;<br>Before I’m accused of sailing off into the sunset on a wide river of my own Kool-aid, I will address another niggle that might be hitting you round about now. It would be dishonest of me not to acknowledge that there is a dark side to awards.&nbsp;One where agencies or individuals pursue awards ruthlessly, even at the expense of the real brand or a client’s needs.&nbsp; I do believe this practice, once rife, has been largely rooted out of the industry. Having been privileged to judge three international awards shows in the past two years, I honestly believe the industry has grown up in this regard.&nbsp;No one has the time or money for that kind of recklessness anymore.&nbsp;And with a much sharper focus on effectiveness and measurement in all categories, I think there is more balance in the judging process too.<br>&nbsp;<br>The simple fact is that good, real work stands out in judging and is usually awarded accordingly. It’s the work that leaves no questions that get the results. Work in which you can see or sense the client’s support and involvement. This is the kind of work that makes awards shows great and valuable.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ultimately advertising awards, like any awards, give us permission to reach beyond ourselves, a goal to aspire to and a standard to be admired, celebrated and ruthlessly toppled the following year.<br>&nbsp;<br>So here are a few of my favourite picks in this year’s Cannes topple-bait.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Truth, Lies and Advertising: The Art of Account Planning. By Jon Steel.</strong></h3>
<p><em>In this month&#8217;s B+G Book Club, Charlotte Bourke, Junior Planner, takes us through Jon Steel&#8217;s classic.<br /></em></p>
<p>Throughout his book, Steel covers several core ideas concerning account planning, which include exploring the value of consumer research for guiding creative teams; the power held in the creative brief; the importance of working with the creative team, and the role the account planning process (and Steel) played to developing the iconic “<em>Got Milk?</em>” campaign.</p>
<p>Each of these ideas are explored through a mixture of Steel’s personal experiences, with invigorating examples of great advertising and witty anecdotes, leaving us with an engaging, easy-to-read writing style &amp; narrative that remains consistent with Steele’s overall theories on simplicity and common sense towards advertising.</p>
<h4><strong>What did I think</strong></h4>
<p>I’ve really enjoyed reading this Adland staple and think it is a must for everyone to dip in and out of, no matter what stage you’re at in your advertising career. As someone who has only recently stepped foot into the enamouring world of advertising, and more specifically, into that of strategy and planning, this book has been somewhat a godsend.</p>
<p>Despite being written in the early nineties, I feel so much of what Steel discusses still rings true through to the present day – but two key topics stood out most to me.</p>
<p>Firstly, research. One aspect I found particularly interesting was his view on research from a planner’s perspective. Oftentimes, it feels as though research can be easily assumed to be just a numbers game – bigger data, equals greater insights, equals better outcomes, right?</p>
<p>By all means, data certainly can add validity to your research, but what’s more gripping is how Steel homes in on the importance of looking beyond the big numbers; he focuses on being more curious, being better at listening to people and asking the right questions – lots of them – to create a human connection.</p>
<p>I find this view most fascinating: in a world where we’re so digitally advanced and big data-driven, but on their own can data and algorithms <em>truly</em> interpret human emotion or understand human experience. There is so much to learn about people; by remaining inquisitive and constantly feeding that curiosity, a planner’s work will uncover rich insights and better interpret that data and understand those unspoken human truths that lead to thoughts that inspire great creative ideas – something which I believe big data and technology will struggle to fully accomplish.</p>
<p>Secondly, Steel examines the role of creativity and the importance of properly approaching the creative brief;  both elements that are  just as vital to the work of the modern-day planner as they were thirty years ago. In essence, Steel demonstrates how good planning will always support creativity and go on to incite powerful creative ideas. This book reminds you of  creativity’s amazing power. It acts as an endless means to make everything better for everyone and when deployed properly, can work in so many wonderful ways and be utilised to solve a myriad of complex problems, both for clients and consumers.</p>
<p>Overall, I feel this book gives a lot of itself in its some 300 pages – you’ll giggle, you’ll think, you’ll learn. It’s filled with rich knowledge, honest truths and excellent case examples that do well in capturing what it really is that a planner does and how they can bring value to the table. On a final note, the biggest takeaway from my reading of this book is as modest as it is simple, and that is: always feed your curiosities. Be interested, be intrigued, listen well; talk to everyone who crosses your path and read everything you can because great ideas can be born from anywhere.</p>
<h4><strong>Who should read it</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who is starting out in their planning career (but honestly, I feel that anyone starting out in advertising should give this a once over to get a grasp of some key basics).</li>
<li>Someone looking for some logical, witty goodness with excellent campaign examples.</li>
</ul>

<p><em data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">by Barry Smith, Head of Design<br /></em></p>
<p>When I think back, my earliest memory of a brand wasn’t really of a brand at all. Rather, it was a “brand” my two siblings and I made up based on the person who gifted it to us.</p>
<p>Our grandparents lived in County Sligo and, whenever we traversed the then very bumpy roads of the country while perched uncomfortably in the back seat of our parents Volvo to visit them, we would arrive to a tantalising treat. Knowing we were coming, our Grandad always purchased three flat penny Cadbury Dairy Milk bars before hiding them around his house for us to excitedly hunt for, impatiently tear into and deliriously devour upon our arrival. The excitement of receiving these glorious foil-and-purple-paper-wrapped treats after a long and exhausting journey left an indelible mark on our impressionable young minds.</p>
<p>Before we could ever comprehend the idea of design, its seductive power was already influencing us. The iconic packaging with its purple and white typography – that we couldn’t properly read or really understand in our tender years – surrounded sleek and stunning gold foil which tightly enveloped the luxurious milk chocolate. The combination of colours and textures set our young minds alight with anticipation while the time it took to remove the dual-wrapper only added to our suspense, acting as a final frustrating barrier to the delicacy within.</p>
<p>Our earliest impressions of the iconic packaging design were supplanted by something more powerful – emotional connection. The packaging itself became a visual shorthand for our familial happiness, forever replacing for us the universally-recognised Cadbury’s Dairy Milk name to the much more emotive name of “Grandad Bars”.</p>
<p>But our shared experience belies a hidden and universal truth – first impressions built on emotional connections last a lifetime. Which got me thinking first about the true power and potency of emotion in branding. And second, about the importance of design and a brand memory that is as much about the purple and gold as it is about the chocolate within.</p>
<p>Design has the power to shape our understanding and experience of the world around us. We notice it because it is smart, beautiful, evocative or useful. It embeds itself in our brains before slipping into our subconscious, ever-ready to influence our decisions, speeding them up to be almost automatic. In my case, on more than one occasion across a sweet shop counter. I have absentmindedly asked for, <em>“… one Grandad Bar please,”</em> only to be met with a suitably quizzical stare from the person standing behind it.</p>
<p>Great design is a brand superpower that is often, at best, overlooked or, at worst, not fully appreciated. It bridges the gap between emotion and logic through carefully applied visual communication, supercharging our understanding to leave lasting marks on our psyches. In the now immortal words of American Graphic Design legend Paul Rand, <em>“Design is the silent ambassador of your brand”. </em>It conveys unspoken messages to our brains that greatly enhance our understanding of brands or their products.</p>
<p>Design unlocks a deeper emotional connection in us, influencing us in ways we may not even realise. As designers responsible for the creation of brand image, we need to know everything about the brands in our charge in order to unlock that design superpower.</p>
<p>Through our craft, we ensure that the brands we work with have the best chance of creating that all-important first impression. Shaping a brand’s design is a position of great excitement, privilege and responsibility. After all, what we create today may form impressions that will last a lifetime.</p>
