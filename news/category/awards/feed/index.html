<p>After a two year wait for Cannes International Festival of Creativity to return, we were absolutely delighted to be awarded our first Lions, even if we weren’t there in person to collect on stage! We won a Gold&nbsp;in the Consumer Services / Business to Business category in Creative Strategy Lions and a Bronze in Consumer Services/ Business to Business in the Brand Experience &amp; Activation Lions.</p>



<p>Both Lions were awarded&nbsp;for our long running Island campaign for Three Ireland featuring Arranmore Island off the coast of Donegal. Three used the island to demonstrate it’s B2B capabilities by treating it as an enterprise customer, bringing connectivity and building a digital hub which enabled multiple initiatives to thrive on the island, after years of economic decline. Our subsequent campaign delivered huge results for the brand, and the island, reversing years of population decline.</p>



<p>Cannes is globally recognised as the benchmark for commercial creativity and to see our Island campaign awarded amongst this international talent is incredible. To illustrate what we mean – the&nbsp;Creative Strategy Lions,&nbsp;which honour work that demonstrates how strategic planning can redefine a brand, received&nbsp;a total of 677 entries and awarded only 3 Golds.</p>



<p>We’re over the moon to win for a campaign which has delivered real, tangible results for real people &amp; the brand. Roll of Cannes 2022!</p>

<p>This week we added to our D&amp;AD awards haul, this time with a prestigious Yellow Pencil and Graphite Pencil for our work with Swim Ireland. We’re really proud of this work and in particular for this win as we were the only Irish agency to be awarded an iconic Yellow Pencil, and only 63 were handed out in total across every category among the thousands and thousands of entries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To win a Yellow Pencil is the pinnacle of creative success in our industry and so we’re delighted to see our work recognised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ad in question was created last summer for Drowning Prevention Week for Swim Ireland. It features a young child crying out to their father &#8211; “Daddy! Daddy! Look at me!” The simple phrase is repeated over and over with the message at the end warning parents to never look away while their child is in the water. It’s a hugely important message delivered in a powerful and impactful way. In fact, it will be running again this year as it was so successful last year and the reaction to our ad was overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Yellow Pencil was awarded in the Writing for Advertising category in Radio &amp; Audio and the Graphite Pencil was awarded for Commercials Over 30 Seconds in Radio &amp; Audio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Christmas, we opened the World’s first Connected Restaurant for Three Ireland + Samsung Ireland, giving some lucky families the chance to have Christmas dinner in Dublin with the ones they miss in Sydney. </p>
<p>Our unique pop up brought families split between Ireland and Australia together for Christmas, despite the 17,209km distance and 11-hour time difference between them. Demand for bookings at the restaurant was exceptionally high, with enough table requests to fill the 4-day pop up for 3-months straight. Watch the best moments from The Connected Restaurant: </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Wow, that was intense.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The rebooted Kinsale Sharks 2018 was as raucous and inspirational as ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gone was the infamous sit down Gala Awards Ceremony (Bloody right that’s Trevor Beattie at the next table), and instead the festival organisers served up a cracking lineup of speakers, including the legendary Mark Denton and Nils Leonard &#8211; to name just two.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It wasn’t Mark Denton’s iconic outdoor work for Nike and Wrangler that stuck in the mind (that was already firmly fixed – Michael Jordan versus Isaac Newton anyone?), it was that when a great idea takes shape in his<br />
 imagination he doesn’t rest until it finds form in the world. Here’s a man who believes that a great idea shouldn’t die before it’s had the chance to live. To hell with the whim of a client lacking faith in a thought, Mark Denton makes up for it in abundance. And when his belief in an idea’s potential is harnessed with unwavering self-belief he creates work that transcends its initial iteration.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That same creative drive, one that’s reluctant to bend to a higher authority other than the work itself, was also a theme of Nils Leonard’s talk. Uncommon is founded on the principal of only working with brands that share a common belief to ‘make a difference’ in the world, and if those brands are in short supply then the team at Uncommon will create them, such as Halo, the world’s first compostable coffee capsule.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He passionately expressed the need for agencies to be stronger about backing their own ideas instead of waiting for approval. It reminded me of a Seth Godin quote that what makes someone a professional is that they can<br />
 be unsupervised, but instead we are all too guilty of waiting for approval before acting on our better instincts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And when you follow your better instincts you will uncover great work. What are the things that stir you? What makes you angry? What do you care about more than anything else. What pisses you off? These are the questions Nils Leonard asks of himself and it’s reflected in his work. Like Mark Denton, it demonstrates a level of personal investment in the work that elevates it beyond the ordinary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like any creative work, its merits, or lack of, can be debated a million different ways from an infinite number of perspectives, but one thing that is irrefutable is an aura of passion radiating from work that’s born of a deep personal investment. That care does shine through.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It also shone through in terms of the work that was recognised by the judges this year. Of course, like at any advertising awards show, that recognition was as predictable as it was unpredictable, with Golds for already iconic work including Wieden+Kennedy’s Nike Nothing beats a Londoner film, Energy BBDO’s Prescribed to Death campaign, as well as the beautifully crafted film work by Nexus for Wimbledon and the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Irish advertising more than held its own on the International stage, and at Boys + Girls we were delighted to take home 7 Sharks for a myriad of different clients, including Energia, Irish Heart Foundation, ŠKODA and Three.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But as I absorbed all the wonderful work I was reminded of the fact that while the briefs come and go, as we move quickly from one campaign to the next, and while this months work is on air and we’re already thinking about next year, there’s one constant – you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the great copywriter, Paul Fishlock, once said: “If you don’t enjoy writing it, you can sure as fuck bet nobody will enjoy reading it.” So don’t just do your job, throw yourself into it. Invest every ounce of your being, and leave nothing behind knowing you will resurface in the work, and find new form in unexpected and brilliant ways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every two years, the best of the best join IAPI as they reveal who has won a coveted ADFX award for marketing effectiveness. These awards are so important to our industry as they prove that the work we do has hard commercial results for our clients. It’s not just self congratulatory agency fodder &#8211; we’re delivering proper business results for our clients! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we were delighted to add 3 more ADFX award to our trophy cabinet, one for Energia and two for Dulux. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energia ‘Clever Humans’ took home a Silver ADFX award for Corporate, Finance &amp; Services category. Our winning entry told the story of how a plucky energy brand abandoned its successful price led communications model in order to drive long-term growth, while still delivering on short-term success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We won two ADFX awards for Dulux this year; a Silver in the FMCG category and a second Silver in the Small Budget category. Our campaign for Dulux broke the mould with its advertising compared to competitors, using emotion to sell the products ultimate benefit &#8211; durability. Our story was quintessentially Irish and fostered a deeper connection with our audience. </span></p>
